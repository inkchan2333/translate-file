Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.76,0:08:38.92,EN,,0,0,0,,so what people do

Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.51,0:08:52.17,EN,,0,0,0,,but as time went on these would just receive

Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.56,0:09:16.50,EN,,0,0,0,,they said that he was banned for cheating behavior
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.50,0:09:19.28,EN,,0,0,0,,this throws an entire another wrench in the situation

Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.29,0:09:21.72,EN,,0,0,0,, because he did multi-account

Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.92,0:09:28.59,EN,,0,0,0,,because of the reputation he had
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.59,0:09:30.72,EN,,0,0,0,, one of the most frustrating things about this though
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.72,0:09:33.75,EN,,0,0,0,,is that white cat told everyone that he was banned from multi-accounting
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.23,0:09:36.84,EN,,0,0,0,,and because support doesn't say why someone is banned
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.84,0:09:38.52,EN,,0,0,0,,he had no proof of it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.52,0:09:40.52,EN,,0,0,0,, and so obviously everyone thought he was lying
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.76,0:09:44.05,EN,,0,0,0,,which is just the first and a couple of really frustrating parts of the story
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.37,0:09:46.40,EN,,0,0,0,, but now gas had basically been thrown on

Dialogue: 0,0:11:28.99,0:11:31.69,EN,,0,0,0,,and he did a stream during a jump section
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.40,0:11:44.94,EN,,0,0,0,,this is a completely reasonable thing
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.94,0:11:46.17,EN,,0,0,0,, to be suspicious about
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.35,0:11:48.88,EN,,0,0,0,,but it also has a really simple explanation

Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.82,0:11:54.12,EN,,0,0,0,,the audio is really just him bottoming out his keys
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.12,0:11:57.44,EN,,0,0,0,,because he's tapping harder during the harder section of the map
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.44,0:11:58.88,EN,,0,0,0,,which is why it's so annoying
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.88,0:12:00.79,EN,,0,0,0,,that so many people are harping on this as being

Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.43,0:12:05.96,EN,,0,0,0,,and then there are the big one's
Dialogue: 0,0:12:05.96,0:12:08.03,EN,,0,0,0,,the first of these is that his cursor teleports
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.03,0:12:10.26,EN,,0,0,0,,during his monster live play
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.52,0:12:22.98,EN,,0,0,0,,and this one is so weak
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.98,0:12:25.76,EN,,0,0,0,, it's the only one that really hits me is blatantly witch hunty
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.76,0:12:27.48,EN,,0,0,0,,since if you watch the video slow down

Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.44,0:12:38.87,EN,,0,0,0,,the thing is that either of these

Dialogue: 0,0:13:17.72,0:13:20.43,EN,,0,0,0,,since for each one of these we have to ask the question
